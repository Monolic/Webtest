        <strong class="first"> Overview </strong>
        <p class="intro">NIAC has identified itself as a Washington, DC-based non-profit organization but has faced controversy in the past over allegations it has worked closely with the Iranian regime.</p><br>
        <p> <a href="https://www.niacouncil.org/"> The National Iranian-American Council (NIAC)</a> is an advocacy group which claims to advocate for nonpartisan action on behalf of the Iranian-American community in domestic and foreign policy issues. In reality, NIAC pushes for a range of left-wing policy positions, including an end to all sanctions on the Iranian regime and supports far-left political officials.</p>
        <br>
        <p> NIAC has faced several allegations of improper alignment with the repressive Islamic Republic of Iran’s regime, most recently in an open letter from three United States Senators which asked the Department of Justice to investigate NIAC as unregistered foreign agents. NIAC has long expressed sympathy towards the Iranian government, encouraging the United States not to respond to the Iranian-backed dictatorship in Syria, even after its regime used chemical weapons against civilians during the Syrian Civil War. NIAC officials have been pictured with Iranian diplomats, and founder and former president Trita Parsi was found to have encouraged the former Iranian ambassador to the Untied Nations to meet with Democrats in Congress.</p><br>
        <p>
            In 2008, NIAC filed a defamation lawsuit against a journalist who alleged that NIAC lobbied on behalf of the Iranian government. The lawsuit was dismissed, and in a subsequent countersuit, it was revealed that NIAC withheld and altered information during the legal discovery process, including altering two-thirds of all calendar records for Parsi’s meetings. NIAC was further found by a Federal Appeals Court judge to have withheld over 5500 emails from its outreach director to various parties. NIAC was ordered to pay the journalist against whom it had originally filed suit over $180,000.
        </p><br>
        <p>A review of NIAC policy stances reveals that the organization frequently echoes Tehran’s rhetoric in redirecting blame at the U.S., not the regime, for Iranian aggression and malfeasance. Its messaging this month, for example, is that U.S. sanctions — not the Iranian regime currently spending nearly $7 billion on its terrorist Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and billions more on corruption, foreign-arms export and nuclear-weapons development — is to blame for Iranian poverty and suffering. Last December, it outrageously alleged that the attacks on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and U.S. forces elsewhere in Iraq were not the fault of the regime-backed militias that carried out the attacks, but rather of President Trump. NIAC has called the U.S. Treasury Department’s efforts to restrict banking from Iran “disruptive and discriminatory,” bitterly noting that U.S. financial institutions “proved immune to NIAC’s . . . reproach,” with seemingly no recognition of the genuine risks posed by banking ties with a regime considered the largest state sponsor of terrorism. In 2019, NIAC president Jamal Abdi echoed an Iranian regime conspiracy theory that Iranian attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman — allegations that were corroborated by the U.S., the United Kingdom, Germany, and regional allies — were false-flag operations “orchestrated” by the Trump administration to provide a pretext for war with Iran. The list of similar regime-sympathetic positions held by NIAC goes all the way back to its founding.</p>
